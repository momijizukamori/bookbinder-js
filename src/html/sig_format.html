    <summary>A note on calculating signature lengths</summary>
    <p>
      In this code, the length of a signature is the number of full-sized sheets of paper per
      signature. For a folio book, this means that the number of folds you punch through when sewing
      together a signature is the same as the number of sheets in the signature, as each sheet has
      one fold. For quarto, this will be two folds for each sheet - octavo, four; sextodecimo,
      eight. Calculate your signature lengths accordingly (in particular, you almost certainly don't
      want more than one sheet for sextodecimo).

  <h3>Wacky Small Layouts</h3>
  <p class="flash variant">
    These layouts contain one or more signature per printed page. They use only the "File Info" and
    "Printer" settings. The names are arbitrary and hold no standardized meaning.

    <p>
      Cut along the lines <i>or</i> cut just extra bit off the top (along exposed "top" of page) and
      then fold up along the dotted lines (if trimming, you can just trim off the cruft at the
      bottom-- tops need to be even for leveling purposes however). Outer margins intentionally
      under-marked so you can trim wherever feels right after folding & assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the most paper efficient of layouts, but it's optimized for organization (if a signature
      is just one page, harder to botch the ordering) and many, smaller signatures make for rounder
      backs and large swell in my [six's] opinion (which helps w/ nice shoulders, if you're into
      that sort of thing)

      The classic no-cut, single page zine! Just fold it up right and you've got yourself a mutant
      non-standard folio making an 8 page little fellow-- all extra pages beyond 8 are discarded.
      For better folding instructions than I could possibly write, see:

      Cut out the rows. Fold up the folios like a zig-zag (two per face). Then fold the center of

      Note that when folding, it's important for the
      <b>center of the folios to line up</b>. That's what I measure against (less so fretting about

      Thankfully most small layouts fit on one page-- easy enough to do a test print and make sure
      you're duplexing correctly (if that's your route)

      Cut out the rows. Fold up the folios like a big zig-zag (two per face). Then fold the first 2
      folios into a signature and the last 3 folios into a signature. I often cut them apart only
      when I'm stitching things together.
