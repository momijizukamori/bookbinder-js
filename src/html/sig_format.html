      <summary>A note on calculating signature lengths</summary>
      <p>
        In this code, the length of a signature is the number of full-sized sheets of paper per
        signature. For a folio book, this means that the number of folds you punch through when
        sewing together a signature is the same as the number of sheets in the signature, as each
        sheet has one fold. For quarto, this will be two folds for each sheet - octavo, four;
        sextodecimo, eight. Calculate your signature lengths accordingly (in particular, you almost
        certainly don't want more than one sheet for sextodecimo).

        Cut along the lines <i>or</i> cut just extra bit off the top (along exposed "top" of page)
        and then fold up along the dotted lines (if trimming, you can just trim off the cruft at the
        bottom-- tops need to be even for leveling purposes however). Outer margins intentionally
        under-marked so you can trim wherever feels right after folding & assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not the most paper efficient of layouts, but it's optimized for organization (if a signature
        is just one page, harder to botch the ordering) and many, smaller signatures make for
        rounder backs and large swell in my [six's] opinion (which helps w/ nice shoulders, if
        you're into that sort of thing)

        The classic no-cut, single page zine! Just fold it up right and you've got yourself a mutant
        non-standard folio making an 8 page little fellow-- all extra pages beyond 8 are discarded.

        Cut out the rows. Fold up the folios like a big zig-zag (two per face). Then fold the first
        2 folios into a signature and the last 3 folios into a signature. I often cut them apart
        only when I'm stitching things together.
